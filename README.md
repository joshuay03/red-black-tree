If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install red-black-tree

## Usage

```ruby
Work = Struct.new :min_latency, keyword_init: true

class WorkNode < RedBlackTree::Node
  def <=> other
    if other.instance_of? RedBlackTree::LeafNode
      1
    else
      self.data.min_latency <=> other.data.min_latency
    end
  end
end

tree = RedBlackTree.new

tree << WorkNode.new(Work.new min_latency: 0.8)
tree << WorkNode.new(Work.new min_latency: 1.2)
tree << WorkNode.new(Work.new min_latency: 0.8)
tree << WorkNode.new(Work.new min_latency: 0.4)

until tree.empty?
  work = tree.shift # 0.4, 0.8, 0.8, 1.2
  # process work
end
```
